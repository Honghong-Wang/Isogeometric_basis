# Isogeometric Analysis and Finite Element Method

The repo contains code to show how to implement FEM/IGA, coming from my dissertation (link below). Main topic is Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), but some code is there also for the Finite Element Method (FEM). The code was mostly written in 2009 for Matlab. In 2021 I improved it a bit and patched it to work with Octave, which seems to work very well. The repo contains:

* 2.3: code showing how to solve 1D problems using the Finite Element Method (FEM);
* 3.1: examples on how to draw curves and surfaces with implicit and parametric equations;
* 3.3: implementation of Bezier curves and surfaces with examples;
* 3.4: implementation of B-spline basis functions, curves and surfaces with examples;
* 3.5: implementation of NURBS basis functions, curves and surfaces with examples;
* 4.5: implementation of IGA on 1D problems with B-splines and NURBS, including h-refinement via knot insertion and degree elevation.
